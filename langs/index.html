                    Here is a collection of languages I have made. Some are for programming in, and some are for other purposes. 
                    My esolangs page may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Ashli_Katt" target="_blank">here</a>. This page only shows highlights.
                </p>
                
                <br><h2>Kindling</h2><p>
                    Kindling is a linker language for DiamondFire. It is heavily inspired by Common Lisp.<br>
                    Its dedicated page may be found <a rel="canonical" href="kindling">here</a>.
                </p>

                <br><h2>Foreach</h2><p>
                    Foreach is an esoteric programming language where the only control flow is for-each loops and function calls. 
                    The documentation and interpreter may be found <a rel="canonical" href="foreach">here</a>.
                </p>
                
                <br><h2>Cast</h2><p>
                    Cast is an esoteric programming language where the only operation is unsafely casting user-defined types between eachother. 
                    The language ended up being a strange form of functional programming.
                    The documentation and interpreter may be found <a rel="canonical" href="cast">here</a>.
                </p>

                <br><h2>Tupilled</h2><p>
                    Tupilled is an esoteric programming language I co-designed, where the only datatype is tuples and lambda expressions. It is inspired by functional programming principles.
                    The documentation may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tupilled" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                </p>
                
                <br><h2>Bullshit</h2><p>
                    Bullshit is an esoteric programming language designed to be completely horrible, but not impossible, to work with.
                    The documentation may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Bullshit" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>

                <br><h2>Terne</h2><p>
                    Terne is one of the first languages I designed. It is a functional language that supports lambdas, bits, and arrays of bits as the only datatypes.
                    It features a highly dynamic syntax that (unknown to be at the time) makes the language very hard to compile. 
                </p>

                <br><h2>Fire</h2><p>
                    Fire is a work-in-progress language intended to transpile to Kindling for DiamondFire. It is heavily based on Rust and Kotlin.
