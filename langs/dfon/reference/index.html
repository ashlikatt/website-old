                <p>
                    DiamondFire Object Notation is a JSON-like language for constant data on DiamondFire plots. It is not a programming language.
                    DFON was created to streamline the production of games with large amounts of constant data. It may be helpful for things like weapon stats,
                    map regions, npc dialogue, etc.<br><br>

                    It is recommended to have an understanding of <a rel="external" href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank" class="externalLink">JSON</a>
                    before using DFON, as they share many similarities.
                </p>





                <br><h2>Basic Structure</h2><p>
                    A DFON file contains exactly one dictionary and nothing else. 
                    Dictionaries are explained in greater detail below, but for now this is what they look like. (Note that whitespace is not significant)
                    <br>

<span class="codeSample">{
    <span class="ident">key</span>: <span class="str">"value"</span>,
    <span class="ident">anotherKey</span>: <span class="str">"another value"</span>
}</span>

                This top-level dictionary that occupies the entire file is called the "main dictionary." The main dictionary is special because when compiled, 
                its keys will become global variables for your plot to use. This is in contrast to other dictionaries, which will compile to an actual dictionary value in DiamondFire.
                <br><br>
                When compiled, the above example will create a template that sets two global variables called "key" and "anotherKey", both set to their respective strings.
                <br><br>
                Comments can be written using two slashes, or slash-star for multiline comments. Comments are completely ignored by the compiler and serve only to document or explain things to the programmer.

                <span class="codeSample">{
    <span class="comment">// This is the main dictionary</span>
}

<span class="comment">/* This is a multi-line comment!
   They are useful for documenting large sections of your file. */</span></span>

                </p>
                



                <br><h2>Dictionaries</h2><p>
                    Dictionaries are written as 0 or more comma-separated key-value pairs inside curly braces. Trailing commas are allowed.
                    Each key and value is separated with a colon symbol. Keys are either identifiers or strings (covered later), while values can be any DFON data type.
<span class="codeSample">{
    <span class="ident">globalVariable</span>: {
        <span class="ident">key1</span>: <span class="str">"Hello"</span>,
        <span class="ident">key2</span>: <span class="str">"World"</span>,
    }
}</span> 
                    The example above will compile to a single global variable titled "globalVariable". 
                    The variable will contain a dictionary with entries "key1" and "key2" set to the "Hello" and "World" strings, respectively.
                </p>




                <br><h2>Strings and Text</h2><p>
                    Strings are written as a pair of single or double quotes with text inside.
                    Backslashes are used as an escape character, and all of the usual candidates may be escaped. (n, r, t, b, \, ', ", newlines)<br>
                    All of the following are valid strings.
<span class="codeSample"><span class="str">"Hello"
'I love "strings"'
"New <span class="escaped">\n</span> Line"
""
'<span class="escaped">\\</span>'</span> <span class="comment">// This is just a single backslash</span>
</span>
                    Styled Text is written exactly the same way as strings, but with a "T" before the first quote.
<span class="codeSample"><span class="text">T"&lt#FFFFFF&gtthis is text"</span>
<span class="text">t'the "T" in text may be lowercase'</span></span>            
                </p>



                <br><h2>Identifiers</h2><p>
                    Identifiers must begin with an underscore or letter, and may contain letters, underscores, and numbers.
                    They are only used as a more concise syntax for dictionary keys compared to strings.
<span class="codeSample"><span class="ident">identifier
Ident
_ident33
_
_9identifier5
</span></span>
                    Identifiers are the only element where whitespace may be significant. "a a" is distinct from "aa".
                </p>



                <br><h2>Numbers</h2><p>
                    Numbers can be written in base-10 as you'd expect, or in either Hex, Octal, or Binary by beginning the number with 0.
                    Numbers may also have underscores anywhere inside of them for organization.<br>
                    All of the following are valid numbers.
<span class="codeSample"><span class="number">2,
3.5
-1.235
1_000_000_000
0b1101 <span class="comment">// 13</span>
-0o7700 <span class="comment">// -4032</span>
0xFF_CC_77 <span class="comment">// 16764023</span></span></span>  
                    DiamondFire stores numbers as 64-bit longs with a fixed decimal position of 3 digits (base-10). 
                    The compiler on my site treats numbers as 64-bit floats. Generally speaking, there should be no issues but keep it in mind.
                </p>





                <br><h2>Locations and Vectors</h2><p>
                    Locations are written as 3 or 5 comma-separated numbers inside of parenthesis. The numbers are in the order: X, Y, Z, Pitch, Yaw. Trailing commas are allowed.<br>
                    The following are valid locations:
<span class="codeSample"><span class="loc">(-15, 62, 15)</span>
<span class="loc">(50.5, 100.5, 50.5, 0, 90)</span>
</span> 

                Vectors are similar to locations, being written as 3 comma-separated numbers inside of angle brackets. The numbers are in the order: X, Y, Z. Trailing commas are allowed.<br>
                The following are valid vectors:
<span class="codeSample"><span class="vec">&lt1, 0, 0&gt,</span>
<span class="vec">&lt-1, 0.5, 0&gt</span>
</span>

                </p>
                










                <br><h2>Lists</h2><p>
                    Lists are written using square brackets with 0 or more comma-separated values inside. Trailing commas are allowed.<br>
                    The following are valid lists:
<span class="codeSample">[<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>]
[
    <span class="str">"Hello"</span>,
    <span class="str">"World"</span>,
]
</span> 
                    Lists may hold any value, including dictionaries and other lists.
                </p>

                <br><h2>Macros</h2><p>
                    Macros are defined at the top of the file, before the main dictionary. They specify a shorthand syntax for a value.
                    They are not function calls, they internally expand out into their defined value.<br>
                    The following are valid macros:
<span class="codeSample"><span class="keyword">macro</span> <span class="ident">hour</span>() = <span class="number">3600</span>

<span class="keyword">macro</span> <span class="ident">pair</span>(<span class="ident">x</span>) = [<span class="ident">x</span>, <span class="ident">x</span>]

<span class="keyword">macro</span> <span class="ident">single</span>(<span class="ident">key</span>, <span class="ident">value</span>) = {
    <span class="ident">key</span>: <span class="ident">value</span>
}
</span> 
                    Macro parameters may be referenced with simply their name. <br>
                    The following are valid macro calls:
                    <span class="codeSample"><span class="ident">hour</span>() <span class="comment">// Compiles to 3600</span>

<span class="ident">pair</span>(<span class="number">3</span>) <span class="comment">// Compiles to [3, 3]</span>

<span class="ident">single</span>(<span class="str">"h"</span>, <span class="number">5</span>) <span class="comment">// Compiles to { h: 5 }</span>
</span> 
                    Be careful with macros, if not properly handled they can easily expand into large values!
                </p>



                <br><h2>Large Example</h2><p>
                    Sometimes it's easier to learn by looking at an example. Here is an example of DFON in action.
<span class="codeSample"><span class="comment">// Holds all game data</span>
{

    <span class="comment">// Used for blockdata lookups</span>
    <span class="ident">dirMap</span>: {
         <span class="ident">east</span>: <span class="vec">&lt 1,  0,  0&gt</span>,
         <span class="ident">west</span>: <span class="vec">&lt-1,  0,  0&gt</span>,
        <span class="ident">north</span>: <span class="vec">&lt 0,  0, -1&gt</span>,
        <span class="ident">south</span>: <span class="vec">&lt 0,  0,  1&gt</span>,
           <span class="ident">up</span>: <span class="vec">&lt 0,  1,  0&gt</span>,
         <span class="ident">down</span>: <span class="vec">&lt 0, -1,  0&gt</span>,
    },

    <span class="comment">// Stores mineable block information</span>
    <span class="ident">blockData</span>: {
        <span class="str">'stone'</span>: {
            <span class="ident">miningTime</span>: <span class="number">40</span>,
            <span class="ident">pickaxePower</span>: <span class="number">0</span>,
            <span class="ident">drops</span>: [<span class="str">'stone'</span>],
        },
        <span class="str">'andesite'</span>: {
            <span class="ident">miningTime</span>: <span class="number">60</span>,
            <span class="ident">pickaxePower</span>: <span class="number">1</span>,
            <span class="ident">drops</span>: [<span class="str">'stone'</span>, <span class="str">'iron_scrap'</span>, <span class="str">'none'</span>],
        },
        <span class="str">'cobblestone'</span>: {
            <span class="ident">miningTime</span>: <span class="number">80</span>,
            <span class="ident">pickaxePower</span>: <span class="number">2</span>,
            <span class="ident">drops</span>: [<span class="str">'stone'</span>, <span class="str">'gold_scrap'</span>, <span class="str">'none'</span>],
        },
    },
}
</span> 
                    This code, when compiled, will create two variables: "dirMap" and "blockData" for use by the plot.
                </p>


                <br><h2>Compilation</h2><p>
                    Compiled DFON code will generate one process, and 0 or more functions. All generated templates need to be placed down to work.
                    You will need to manually call the process when the first player joins the plot, there is no need to manually call the functions.
                </p>

                <br><h2>Limits</h2><p>
                    DFON isn't a good fit for every project. Using it means that any time you want to change data, you will need to edit the script,
                    recompile the code, and replace the templates. This is made even harder if multiple people are working on your plot.<br><br>

                    The main reasons to use DFON are to make constant data easier to read through and spot bugs with, as well as providing a sort of "backup" in case 
                    code is accidentally lost. Constant data is often more devastating to lose than a simple algorithm.<br><br>

                    I am still currently thinking about implementation for function hooks, macros, embedded metadata, support for all DF datatypes, and support for items, among other things.
