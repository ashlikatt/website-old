                    Here is a collection of my main gamedev projects. 
                </p>
        
                <br><h2>Untitled Sewer Game </h2><p>
                    This was a Game Jam project developed on-and-off over two weeks. 
                    I completed the project alone, and updated the game afterwards to polish and expand on various mechanics.<br>
                    It may be played <a href="sewer" target="_blank">here</a>, however is still heavily unfinished. 
                </p>

                <br><h2>Parkour</h2><p>
                    This is a game that I made when I was around 14 or so. 
                    It's a simple parkour game that generates its levels.<br>
                    It may be played <a href="parkour" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                </p>

                <br><h2>Card Games</h2><p>
                    When I was bored in Computer Science class my senior year of high school, I made a very simple card game engine.
                    I implemented Freecell, which may be played <a href="freecell" target="_blank">here</a>, 
                    and Black Jack which may be played <a href="blackjack" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                </p>

                <br><h2>Twenty Four</h2><p>
                    Twenty Four is a concept for a puzzle/exploration game designed around being stuck in Time Limbo. 
                    It has heavy influence from Yume Nikki and its successor, Yume 2kki.
                    <br><br>
                    Several tools have been developed for potential future development of the game, including my <a href="/tools/mapplanner">Map Planner</a>.
