                    Here is a collection of my main gamedev projects.

                <br><h2>Untitled Sewer Game </h2><p>
                    Untitled Sewer Game was a Game Jam project developed on-and-off over two weeks. 
                    I completed the project alone, and updated the game afterwards to polish and expand on various mechanics.<br>
                    It may be played <a href="sewer/game.html">here</a>. 
                </p>

                <br><h2>Twenty Four</h2><p>
                    Twenty Four is a concept for a puzzle/exploration game designed around being stuck in Time Limbo. 
                    It has heavy influence from Yume Nikki and its successor, Yume 2kki.
                    <br><br>
                    Several tools have been developed for potential future development of the game, including my <a href="/langs/mapplanner/editor.html">Map Planner</a>.
