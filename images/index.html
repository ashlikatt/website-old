        I made this document to write down my thoughts and feelings. I don't really know what to write today, though<br>

        <h1>june 2nd, 2014</h1>
        some days i'll sit and relax, and it's nice. i'll keep relaxing all day until I realize how late it is,
        then i'll go to bed. it's nice.<br>
        when I relax, I like to think. I like to fantasize the various lives I could lead. 
        I could be a different person, live in a different world, or go on different adventures<br>

        I started learning javascript, it's really fun! the worst part is finding the errors, but it's okay<br>
        computers have always fascinated me, i use them every day anyway! might as well learn how to use them to their fullest

        school is going well, though I often get so tired that I end up relaxing most of the day<br>
        I usually spend most of my productive time working on my coding projects anyway, rather than homework. 
        it's okay though
