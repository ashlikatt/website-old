                <h2>General</h2><p>
                    Hello! I am Ashli Katt!<br>
                    I'm a transgender woman (she/her) from Texas. <span id="age"></span>My passion is for computer science and programming.
                </p>
                <br><h2>Programming</h2><p>
                    I have been programming since I was 13, I particularly enjoy text processing applications and programming experimental video games.
                    I generally prefer to code in Rust or Kotlin, however I also commonly use JavaScript, Java, and Haskell for various projects.
                    I am most comfortable with using Java, as I have used it for about half a decade and used it more than any other language.
                    I <i>love</i> esolangs, and have designed several myself on the <a href="../langs/languages.html">Languages</a> page.
                </p>
                <br><h2>Schooling and Certifications</h2><p>
                    I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am a certified Unity Programmer as of 17 April, 2023.
                </p>
