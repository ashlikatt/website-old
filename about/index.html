                    Hello! I am Ashli Katt! (she/they/it)<br>
                    I'm a transgender catgirl from Texas! <span id="age"></span>My passion is for computer science and programming.<br>

                <br><h2>Programming</h2><p>
                    I have been programming since I was 13, I particularly enjoy text processing applications and programming experimental video games.
                    I generally prefer to code in Rust or Kotlin, however I also commonly use JavaScript, Java, and Haskell for various projects.
                    I am most comfortable with using Java, as I have used it for about half a decade and used it more than any other language.
                    I <i>love</i> esolangs, and have designed several myself on the <a rel="canonical" href="/langs/languages">Languages</a> page.
                </p>
