                <h2>General</h2><p>
                    Hello! I am Ashli Katt! (she/they/it)<br>
                    I'm a transgender girl from Texas! <span id="age"></span>My passion is for computer science and programming.<br>

                <br><h2>Programming</h2><p>
                    I have been programming since I was 13, I particularly enjoy text processing applications and programming experimental video games.
                    I generally prefer to code in Rust or Kotlin, however I also commonly use JavaScript, Java, and Haskell for various projects.
                    I also have some experience with SQL, however I'm still learning!
                    <br><br>
                    I am most comfortable with Java, as I have used it for about half a decade, more than any other language.
                    I am experienced with Minecraft Plugin development, and have been doing so on and off for years, currently a volunteer developer for mcdiamondfire.com.
                    <br><br>
                    I <i>love</i> esolangs, and have designed several myself on the <a rel="canonical" href="/langs">Languages</a> page.
                    
                </p>
                <br><h2>Schooling and Certifications</h2><p>
                    I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
                    I am certified in MS Excel as of 28 February, 2020.
