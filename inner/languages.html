        <h1>My Languages</h1><p>
            Here is a collection of languages I have made. Some are for programming in, and some are for other purposes. 
            My esolangs page may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Ashli_Katt">here</a>. This page only shows highlights.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Foreach</h2><p>
            Foreach is an esoteric programming language where the only control flow is for-each loops and function calls. 
            The documentation may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tupilled">here</a>. The interpreter may be found <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1904852">here</a>.
        </p>
        
        <br><h2>Cast</h2><p>
            Cast is an esoteric programming language where the only operation is unsafely casting user-defined types between eachother. 
            The language ended up being a strange form of functional programming.
            The documentation may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Cast">here</a>. The interpreter may be found <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1916455">here</a>.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Tupilled</h2><p>
            Tupilled is an esoteric programming language I co-designed, where the only datatype is tuples and lambda expressions. It is inspired by functional programming principles.
            The documentation may be found <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Foreach">here</a>. 
        </p>
        
        <br><h2>MapPlanner</h2><p>
            MapPlanner is a graph storage format intended to assist with developing games with a large number of areas. (As my games tend to have)
            A small CLI to interact with the format may be found <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1922443">here</a>.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Terne</h2><p>
            Terne is one of the first languages I designed. It is a functional language that supports lambdas, bits, and arrays of bits as the only datatypes.
            It features a highly dynamic syntax that (unknown to be at the time) makes the language very hard to compile. 
        </p>
        
        <br><h2>Kindling</h2><p>
            Kindling is a work-in-progress linker language for DiamondFire. It is heavily inspired by Common Lisp.
        </p>

        <br><h2>Fire</h2><p>
            Fire is a work-in-progress language intended to transpile to Kindling for DiamondFire. It is heavily based on Rust and Kotlin.
