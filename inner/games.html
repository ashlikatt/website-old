        <h1>My Games</h1><p>
            Here is a collection of my main gamedev projects. 
        </p>

        <br><h2>Untitled Sewer Game </h2><p>
            Untitled Sewer Game was a Game Jam project developed on-and-off over two weeks. 
            I completed the project alone, and updated the game afterwards to polish and expand on various mechanics.<br>
            It may be found <a href="games/sewer/game.html">here</a>. 
        </p>

        <br><h2>Compass to Dawn</h2><p>
            Compass to Dawn was a senior class project that I helped develop. The game itself is a story driven game about a post-apocalyptic world.
            I developed a text-based language to encode the game's dialogue/decision tree and implemented the tokenizer, parser, and runtime interpreter. The game was my first introduction to Unity.
            Prior to this, I had only developed games with Bevy (for Rust), Processing (for Java), and raw Javascript.
